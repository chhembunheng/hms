    <p>&emsp;Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Request access</strong> to your data (commonly known as a “subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of your data and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
        <li><strong>Request correction</strong> of your data. This enables you to ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your data under certain circumstances, for example, if you consider that there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
            remove your data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
        <li><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your data where we are relying on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.</li>
        <li><strong>Request restriction</strong> of processing of your data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your data, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
        <li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your data to another party.</li>
