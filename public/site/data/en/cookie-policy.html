  <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 27, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. What are cookies?</h2>
  <p>
    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, mobile)
    when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work, improve performance,
    remember preferences, and show more relevant content and ads.
  </p>
  <p>Cookies can be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Session cookies</strong> (deleted when you close your browser)</li>
    <li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> (stay until they expire or you delete them)</li>
    <li><strong>First-party cookies</strong> (set by this site)</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party cookies</strong> (set by partners such as analytics or ad providers)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We also use similar technologies such as sessionStorage, browser cookies, and tracking pixels.
    In this policy, we call all of these "cookies".
  </p>

  <h2>2. How we use cookies</h2>
  <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>

  <h3>2.1 Strictly necessary cookies (always active)</h3>
  <p>
    These cookies are required for the site to function. Without them, some parts of the site
    won't work properly.
  </p>
  <p>Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Security and fraud prevention</li>
    <li>Keeping you logged in / session management</li>
    <li>Remembering that you already saw (and responded to) the cookie banner</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These cookies do <strong>not</strong> store personal information for marketing purposes.
    They are always active because the website cannot operate correctly without them.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Functional / preference cookies (optional)</h3>
  <p>
    These remember things like language, region, or interface preferences. If you block these,
    you may need to re-enter some preferences every time you visit.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3 Analytics cookies (optional)</h3>
  <p>
    These help us understand how people use the site — for example, which pages are popular,
    which features are confusing, and where errors happen. We use this to improve performance,
    content, and usability, not to directly identify you.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use Google Analytics 4 ("GA4"). GA4 only runs if you choose “Accept all cookies.”
    Until you accept, analytics storage is set to <code>denied</code>, and GA4 will not store analytics cookies in your browser.
  </p>

  <h3>2.4 Personalization &amp; advertising cookies (optional)</h3>
  <p>
    These may be used to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure marketing / ad performance</li>
    <li>Show content or offers that are more relevant to you</li>
    <li>Build remarketing or lookalike audiences</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These cookies are <strong>not</strong> set unless you explicitly accept all cookies.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3. Consent and control</h2>
  <p>
    When you first visit our site, you will see a cookie banner from
    <strong>WINTECH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (Cambodia) Co., LTD</strong>.
    You can choose:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Accept all cookies</strong><br />
      Enables analytics and personalization / advertising cookies.
      We mark consent as “granted” and allow storage for analytics, personalization, and ads.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Only necessary</strong><br />
      Only strictly necessary cookies are kept active.
      Analytics, personalization, and advertising remain disabled.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Decline tracking</strong><br />
      Same effect as “Only necessary,” and we record that you explicitly declined tracking.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your choice is stored in two places:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>sessionStorage</code> under a consent key, so we remember your choice
      for this browser session.
    </li>
    <li>
      A browser cookie called <code>allow_cookie=true</code> (for up to 12 months) if you
      clicked “Accept all cookies.” This prevents us from showing the banner again
      on every visit.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can withdraw consent at any time by clearing your browser cookies and sessionStorage
    for our domain and then reloading the site. After that, the banner will reappear and
    you can make a different choice.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4. Google Analytics 4 and Consent Mode</h2>
  <p>
    We use Google Analytics 4 ("GA4") to measure traffic and usage patterns. GA4 is provided
    by Google.
  </p>
  <p>
    We implement Google Consent Mode to control what data GA4 can store and read.
    Before you consent, we set the following values:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>ad_storage: "denied"</code></li>
    <li><code>ad_user_data: "denied"</code></li>
    <li><code>ad_personalization: "denied"</code></li>
    <li><code>analytics_storage: "denied"</code></li>
    <li><code>functionality_storage: "denied"</code></li>
    <li><code>personalization_storage: "denied"</code></li>
    <li><code>security_storage: "granted"</code> (kept on for basic security and fraud prevention)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you click <strong>Accept all cookies</strong>, we call
    <code>gtag('consent', 'update', { ... 'granted' ... })</code>.
    That switches those settings to <code>"granted"</code>, which allows analytics
    and advertising storage as permitted by your choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do not accept, GA4 remains in restricted mode, and analytics cookies are not stored.
  </p>

  <p>
    For more on how Google collects and processes data,
    please see Google’s Privacy Policy and the data protection rules
    that apply in your country (for example, GDPR if you are in the EU/EEA or UK).
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>5. How long do cookies last?</h2>
  <p>
    How long a cookie stays on your device depends on what it’s for.
    Some cookies expire when you close your browser (session cookies),
    while others last longer (persistent cookies).
  </p>
  <p>
    Our consent cookie (<code>allow_cookie=true</code>) can last up to 12 months.
    We use it so we don’t repeatedly ask you for the same decision.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6. Managing cookies in your browser</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to the choices in our banner, you can block or delete cookies in your browser settings.
    Most modern browsers let you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Block all cookies</li>
    <li>Block only third-party cookies</li>
    <li>Delete specific cookies</li>
    <li>Clear all browsing data (including cookies, cache, site data)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you block strictly necessary cookies, parts of the site may stop working.
  </p>
  <p>
    Typical locations for these settings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chrome / Edge:</strong> Settings → Privacy and security → Cookies and other site data</li>
    <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Cookies and Site Data</li>
    <li><strong>Safari:</strong> Settings / Preferences → Privacy</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>7. Do Not Track / Global Privacy Control</h2>
  <p>
    Some browsers and extensions send a “Do Not Track” or “Global Privacy Control”
    signal. Where legally required, we will make a good-faith effort to honor those
    signals. Because support for these standards is not yet consistent across the
    industry, we still recommend setting your cookie preference directly in our banner.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>8. Children’s data</h2>
  <p>
    Our services are not directed to children under the age required by applicable law
    (for example, under 13 in the United States or under 16 in parts of the EU).
    We do not knowingly use cookies to profile children.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>9. Updates to this Cookie Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes in technology, law,
    or our services. If we make material changes, we may update the
    “Last updated” date at the top of this page and, where required, show
    the cookie banner again so you can review the new terms.
  </p>
